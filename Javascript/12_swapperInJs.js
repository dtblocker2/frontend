/* Great question! In JavaScript, you **cannot** use the syntax `a, b = b, a` as you might in Python for swapping values.  
That syntax is **not valid in JavaScript** and will not work as intended.

### The Correct Way to Swap Variables in JavaScript

#### 1. Using Array Destructuring (ES6+)
This is the most Pythonic way in JavaScript:
```js
let a = 1, b = 2;
[a, b] = [b, a];
console.log(a, b); // 2 1
```

#### 2. Using a Temporary Variable (Classic Way)
```js
let a = 1, b = 2;
let temp = a;
a = b;
b = temp;
console.log(a, b); // 2 1
```

### Why Doesn't `a, b = b, a` Work?
- In JavaScript, `a, b = b, a` is interpreted as a [comma operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comma_Operator), **not** as tuple unpacking or destructuring.
- Only the last assignment (`b = a`) is performed, and the value of the entire expression is that assignment's result.
- this is not python

### Summary
- **Use `[a, b] = [b, a];`** for swapping in JavaScript.
- The Python-style `a, b = b, a` does **not** work in JavaScript.
